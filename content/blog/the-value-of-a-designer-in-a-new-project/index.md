Last year I started a new work as a full-stack developer being in charge of a new project.

This company is a gaming company, and the software I would build is a dashboard for an internal advertising monetization platform.An ad monetizing person would be able to set up and configure the necessary settings in this dashboard for each game that has this platform configured in it. A very basic platform already existed but the ad monetisation users (aka the *main users* aka *main stakeholders*) were not satisfied with the existing platform, as they wanted a tool that was more similar to the one at the top of the market.

For that, they needed someone to help them make their dream come true! As a result, I joined the team as the sole developer of this web application.

So first of all I began gathering some requirements as it was the first time that I was doing this. (In other projects, the requirements were already in place as Jira tickets.)

The first thing that I was informed of was that there wasn't any designer or UI/UX expert person in the team, but they were going to outsource one.

Now, my academical background is purely in Computer Science and Software Engineering. I have no artistic background to perform designs and was never an artistic kind of person to begin with.

I always worked as a Full-Stack Developer but when performing frontend, the design was always provided with the requirements, and we would discuss some possible changes and consistencies with the rest of the product.

After discussing my concerns with the product manager, we decided to develop a first version of this platform with a very simple design based on the flow of the already existing backoffice.

And so off I went to work and developed a great working first version of this Web App! It also included a Dark mode which was a really cool challenge to develop and was considered a Nice to have per the requirements. 

After I finished this first version, a designer was hired! I was relieved that I could begin to deliver a lot more value to the future users of the platform since the designer could finally fill the gaps on the technical knowledge. On the first weeks of work, she created the branding for the application, as well as a first version of a complete design system. 

After defining the second version of the UI based on the very same design system and branding, it was time to implement everything. 

As you can imagine, a complete redesign of an application is something that takes a long time, which indeed has been taking. Currently the designer is developing a new color scheme and new user flows according to the user's requirements, while doing User testing in the future. All of these tasks take me back to the time in univeristy where I did a course on Human-Computer Interaction. This subject is very important to consider when developing a product so having someone specialized in this can provide a huge value, and my experience does indeed show that fact.
